## BugFables Plus
Bug Fables Plus is finally here! This is a full game mod adding new content to pretty much all areas of the game. New Medals, Enemies, Items, Bosses, Dungeons and much more! 

Practically everything in the game have seen additions or improvements! Revisit Bugaria with a fresh new look and even more content!

## New Medals
Test out new builds with nearly double the collectible medals all over Bugaria! This time it's not only poison that can make a good build! Every main status effect has its own medals associated with it.

## New Enemies
New enemies have appeared all over Bugaria! Test your mettle and medals against these stronger foes! Enemies, Minibosses and Superbosses, will you be able to beat them all?

## New Items Recipes
Team Snakemouth can now use a vast array of new items! Some of these can be found in the field or in shops, but most will need to be cooked! Time to fill out that recipe book!

## New Quests
There are new requests to fulfill and bugs to help all over Bugaria! Ranging from item request to new fights!

## Pit of Trials
The Cave of Trials has been completely reworked. Now more similar to the TTYD pit, the Pit of Trials offers a tougher challenge available as soon as Chapter 2. Try to reach the deepest floor while fighting new enemies and unique enemy formations!

## New Dungeons and Maps 
Don't hesitate to explore familiar areas! You might find one of the new dungeons that are all over Bugaria! But beware, the enemies guarding these places are no jokes! 

## Stylish!
You can now perform stylish moves after any attack or skill! Press A at key moments to gain stylish points and earn bonuses!

## And so much more!
This mod is full of new features to make playing this game even more enjoyable : Enemies using items, text-skip, visible status-resistances, area-based battle themes, medal categories, new discoveries and records, the list really goes on and on.

We aim at being the ultimate way to play Bug Fables and we hope you'll think so too!
